# RecyclerViewDemo

A simple demo of the Android RecyclerView. This app displays a list
containing 25 (randomly selected) English words. When an item (word)
is clicked a Toast message is displayed indicating which word was
clicked.

This was built based on the example
[here](http://developer.android.com/training/material/lists-cards.html). ```ViewHolder```
has been modified from the example to implement the
```View.OnClickListener``` interface to handle click events on list
items.
